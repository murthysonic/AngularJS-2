# AngularJS-2


Hello Ganesh,

 

As discussed, below are the few concerns we have in my
current project.

We
are asked to create the user stories and plan their delivery sprints ourselves.
We don’t want to end up creating requirements
based on our understanding and work on them when they are not in-line with
business needs.The
created user stories are not reviewed before development and keep changing.Again, since the stories / requirements were
based on our understanding, they get changed post implementation during a demo
session.Requirements
are given at very generic level but not at specific level.With the general requirements, we assume few
things for specific details which hit us back again.Many times we were confused while understanding
the requirements.We
are expected to understand and work on technologies beyond our known technical
skills.We understand that learning the new tech is good
but then we don’t want to make them as our carrier path.It makes us “Jack of all trades but master of
none”. We like to grow as master in our tech stacks as they them self are very
wide.It also sets wrongs expectations with our
client.





















 

We don’t want to get into a situation where things get escalated
and client is unhappy about our performance. We definitely don’t want to set
any sort of wrong expectations.

We need your help in resolving these concerns.

 

Sreeni, 

Please add if I have missed anything.

 

Thanks & Regards,

Murthy M.K
